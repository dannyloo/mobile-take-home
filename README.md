How the app works:

- User enters the beginning and ending IATA locations 
- The user can add as many locations as they want by pressing the "+" button, and scrolling through the list
- Likewise a location can be removed by pressing the "-" button
- The resulting route will be a line drawn from start -> destination 1 -> destination 2 -> etc to simulate
the route of a plane. 
- The blue marker on the map indicates the start location.  
- The user can click on any marker to see more information on the trip 
- If the user enters an incorrect start, they will be told the start is not valid 
- If the user enters an incorrect destination, they will be prompt on which destination is incorrect
- Only valid routes are mapped 
- Cannot have a blank start/destination

The release APK can be also tested. It is found in app/app-release.apk
